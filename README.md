# S2DataProcessing

Atmospheric correction and monthly composites of Sentinel2 imagery

## Initial setup
Run bash script (I still need to create it). The script will do the following:
1. Install Anaconda if not already on your system
2. Create a new conda environment
3. Install correct package versions into the conda environment

## Running the script
To run the Jupyter Notebook, first go to your terminal/commandline and enter:
jupyter notebook

This will launch jupyter in your browser, and you can play with the script from there
