## Goal of this repository:
- Atmospheric correction and cloud removal of Sentinel L1C images to create L2A products. 
- Monthly composites of cloud-free L2A products 

Separate notebooks for each goal? And separate environments?

### Using this repository
Two separate cloud-computing platforms have been explored: Google Earth Engine and Sentinel Hub. The scripts and environments for each platform are developed and stored in their respective folders in this repository. 
The Google Earth Engine scripts are better developed, as the platform is free for everyone to use.
